#Function to generate prime numbers
Simple function to generate prime numbers
x=[2,3,5,193,7,13]
for x in primes:
    print(primes)
 A better way is
 def prime_number(x)
     if x<= 1
        return 1
 
 else
 retun x * prime_number (2x * x-1);
 print (prime_number (5))
 # it should work like this return 1 if no is less than or equal to 0
 the function (2x * x-1)
 1,3,5,7,9,11
 #Breaks after 5
